Project : Simple End 2 End encryption software

about:this project does not cover entire scope of e2ee but just a simple implementation to understand how e2ee works.

1.the secret session key is genreted using Diffie-Hellman key exchange protocol

2.A simple encryption and decryption function are implemented here , aes and cipher modules in go are used here.

3.simple sever is implemented , that is hosted at port number 8080 . server performs few simple operations
    *host the server
    *once a client connects , instigate the keys exchange
    *keep the list of all the clients
    *recieve and send message with clients with thee help of encryption and decryption function
    *once a message is recieved from the client , broadcast it to all the other clients
    *once a client terminates , the client list is updated

4.client connects  to the  server that is hosted a port 8080 and once the connction is established the ,client can interact with other clients


Running:
     In order to run this software first make shure that port 8080 is not being used , if so change the port in the code
     After opening the software in VS code run the server.go first , and in new terminals run as  client.go file and 
     client can interact with other using the server.
